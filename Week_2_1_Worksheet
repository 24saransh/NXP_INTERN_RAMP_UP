1) Write a program, in which user is asked to choice from 0 to 2 for different tasks. . Choosing 0, will execute a function that would add 2 numbers. Choosing 1, will execute a function 
that would subtract 2 numbers, Choosing 2, will execute a function that would multiply 2 numbers. In this program instead os use of switch case, use function pointers.
2) Make a structure and initialise its data variables by creating the object of the structure via pointers. Create a 1-D array of this structure of index 2. And then print 
the values of data variables of the structure.
