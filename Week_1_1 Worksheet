Python Questions:
  1. Create a text file (file 1) and fill it contents with random integers and strings (5000 lines to be filled).Populate strings and integers randomly, but make sure each type consist of minimum 45% of the file . Create another file (file 2). In file 2 read data from file 1; Convert integers to hex numbers in 0x format (i.e. 0x1A,0x10 etc); Reverse the strings (i.e. ABC is a boy. -> yob a si CBA. ). 

C Questions:
1. Write a C functio, to reverse the string. Like  Input to function is "Hey", the function should return as "YEH".
2. Make a user defined structure, with int,char and string data values. Create the Object of this structure. Initialise data values of structure using this object
and print those data values of structure using same object. The object should be created via pointers.
