Python Questions:
  1. Create a text file (file 1) and fill it contents with random integers and strings (5000 lines to be filled).
  Populate strings and integers randomly, but make sure each type consist of minimum 45% of the file . Lngth of each line should be between 15-20 characters
  Create another file (file 2). In file 2 read data from file 1; Convert integers to hex numbers in 0x format (i.e. 0x1A,0x10 etc); 
  Reverse the strings (i.e. ABC is a boy. -> yob a si CBA. ). 

  2. Create a program which takes 2 directory paths as input (via CMD). Copy the contents of directory 1 to directory 2. 
  Also, change the name of all files/folders by adding preffix 'Copy_' and suffix  "__2". Eg: if a file is ABC.txt then copied file should be named Copy_ABC_2.txt 
C Questions:
1. Write a C functio, to reverse the string. Like  Input to function is "Hey", the function should return as "YEH".
2. Make a user defined structure, with int,char and string data values. Create the Object of this structure. Initialise data values of structure using this object
and print those data values of structure using same object. The object should be created via pointers.
